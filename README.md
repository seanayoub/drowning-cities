This interactive webpage was produced by Sean Ayoub.

For this story, I wanted to take a closer look at how the warming climate was going to affect the
world around us, and more specifically, its impacts on precipitation, rainfall, and flooding. The
article opens with a scroll component that walks readers through a data visualization (made with D3)
depicting the average annual rainfall for five select coastal cities in the United States. Further 
down, readers are able to get a closer look at each of these five cities through a responsive map
(made with Leaflet) that depicts the average annual rainfall in a bubble which will adjust as they
slide through the years, up until 2050. I wanted people to better understand how climate change
would affect their country and to become better versed in sustainable practices they could adopt
to combat it, which is why I implemented the final flashcard component, for readers to learn more. 

Data for the scrollytelling visualization and the leaflet map were obtained from the Open-Meteo
Climate Projections API - filtering on precipitation sum. Sources used for the article may be
